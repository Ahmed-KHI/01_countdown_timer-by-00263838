Countdown Timer Project

Overview:

This Countdown Timer is a straightforward yet functional web application developed as part of the 30 Days of 30 Projects initiative from the Governor IT Initiative Program. It serves as an introductory project to enhance my skills in React and client-side rendering.

Key Features:

Set Duration:

Users can input a desired countdown duration in seconds, which is validated to ensure it is a positive number.

Timer Control:

The application provides intuitive controls to:

Start the countdown.
Pause the timer to temporarily halt the countdown without resetting.
Reset the timer to the initial duration set by the user.
Real-Time Display: The remaining time is dynamically displayed in a user-friendly mm:ss format, providing clear visibility of the countdown progress.

Technologies Used:

React: 

Leveraging React hooks for state management and side effects.

TypeScript: 

Utilizing TypeScript for type safety, enhancing code reliability and maintainability.

Conclusion:

This project not only solidifies my understanding of React fundamentals but also demonstrates the practical application of state management, user input handling, and lifecycle methods. The Countdown Timer serves as a foundational project that can be expanded with additional features in the future.
